## Requirements
+ [Arduino Uno](http://amzn.to/2hGccVq)
+ [Micro Servo](http://amzn.to/2hFLUCM)
+ [Distance Sensor](http://amzn.to/2z7jYic) This is the more expensive 3 pin sensor, you can use the cheaper 4 pin sensors, which means adding an echo pin in the set up.
+ Breadboard & Jumper Wires (3 Male to Male, 3 Female to Male)
